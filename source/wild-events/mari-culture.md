title: Mari-Culture
---

Mari-Culture refers to when a wild seafood population is aided so that future wild-harvests are more sustainable and plentiful. Because there is no way to connect products used in the aiding of the wild population to the products harvested from that wild population, we are recommended that this is not recorded, and that the event data starts with the wild harvesting of the products that are intended to be sold into commerce.
