title: Gear Types
description: How to record events based on the different gear types used.
---

Different vessels use different gear types depending on the vessel as well as the commodity being harvested from the wild. In general, we have categorized these different gear types into 2 categories, `continuous deployment` and `non-continuous deployment` gear type. The GSDT recommended approach is if the gear is deployed for an area larger than a square kilometer then it is a `continuous deployement`, otherwise it is `non-continuous deployment`.

## Continuous Deployment
These are gear types that are deployed continuously for long periods of time such as `trawling`. When recording Fishing Events when this gear type is used, it is recommended that a Fishing Event is recorded for each square kilometer that the gear is deployed and products are being harvested.

## Non-Continuous Deployement
These are gear types that are deployed in a non-continuous manner, such as `hook and line` that are deployed for short period of times and then harvested products are collected. It is recommended that a Fishing Event is recorded for each time the gear is deployed.

## FAO Gear Types
A list of the allowed values for gear types can be found at [http://www.fao.org/3/t0367t/t0367t00.htm](http://www.fao.org/3/t0367t/t0367t00.htm).
