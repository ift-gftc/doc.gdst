title: Why IUU?
---

The GDST was formed with representation throughout the global seafood industry, by geography and by supply chain role. This was due to the risk to the entire industry in continued Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing. Without a standard framework for collecting and conveying traceability information, it would be difficult for the industry to have a unifed approach for end-to-end traceability to mitigate IUU fishing.
