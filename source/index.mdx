Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Apollo is a platform for building a **data graph**, a communication layer that seamlessly connects your application clients (such as React and iOS apps) to your back-end services.


### New to Apollo or GraphQL?

It's easy to adopt Apollo incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as a REST API) and migrate functionality at your convenience.
