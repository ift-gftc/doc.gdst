Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ The **Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability** is an international, business-to-business platform established to advance a unified framework for interoperable seafood traceability practices. The Dialogue brings together a broad spectrum of seafood industry stakeholders from across different parts of the supply chain, as well as relevant civil society experts from diverse regions. 

This GitHub documents scenarios outside the scope of the GDST Normative Standards and other explanatory information. GDST realized that to document and standardize every use case of the GDST would be cumbersome, inefficient, and impractical. To both provide flexibility, but also unify approaches to using the GDST normative standard, GDST has created this space to document scenarios and use cases that coincide with GDST, such as regulatory compliance, critical tracking event contingencies, and certification requirements.
