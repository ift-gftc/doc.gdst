title: Feedback and Caveats
description: Process, known issues, caveats and feedback requested.
---
If you are reading this, you have been asked by the Global Dialogue on
Seafood Traceability to provide your expert guidance in the development
of the Best Practices and Implementation Guide for Seafood Traceability
and Interoperability. The following will give you a sense of our
process, known issues, caveats and feedback requested.

## **Process**

> Members of the Global Dialogue will be presented with this document
> first for their feedback, followed by members of the Dialogue Advisory
> Group. Once all feedback has been reviewed and processed, we will
> release another draft for final comment prior to initiating a pilot to
> test this guide in real life.

## **Known Issues**

-   Defining, validating and securely sharing catch areas

-   Implementing EPCIS with JSON for blockchain and other data sharing
    protocols {scheduled for release in EPCIS 2.0 in 2020}

-   Cost/Benefit to various approaches will be evaluated in planned
    pilots

## **Caveats and FYIs**

-   This guide shows a representative supply chain based on the GDST
    secretariat's pilot process. It contains a limited number of
    critical tracking events for demonstration purposes. Additional
    scenarios will be shared in the open source repository in a
    collaborative effort with industry and traceability developers. The
    repository and wiki will be further developed during the pilot
    process through March 2020.

-   The pilot process will be used to test, refine and evaluate
    cost/benefit of various approaches and solutions and provide a
    recommended adoption roadmap for the industry.

-   Links to an open source repository will be provided. This will
    include sample files and example code for usage in pilots and
    productive applications.

-   In addition to regulatory requirements, knowledge and usage of GS1
    Standards is critical for organizations that ship to retailers and
    foodservice companies. Therefore, this guide introduces the reader
    to both and incorporates them into the interoperability guidance.

-   This is not intended to be a new IUU certification scheme or
    mandated standard. The goal is to provide useful tools that the
    industry broadly adopts because they make sense.

-   The KDE capture and share indicates redundancy -- this is to
    mitigate the risk of breaks in the chain or if a participant does
    not have visibility to prior steps (for a variety of reasons).

## **Feedback Requested**

-   Does this guide provide you with what you need to develop
    interoperable traceability systems?

-   Is this guide clearly written and presented? Can the guide be used
    in a reproduceable manner (EPCIS files from this guidance are
    produced similar ways for similar supply chain scenarios)?

-   Are there any additions or deletions that would improve this guide?
